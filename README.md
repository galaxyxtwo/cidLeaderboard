# communityStats

## Overview
Communities need analytics as much as developers. CommunityStats is a simple tool to share analytics stats from [Leto](https://leto.gg/) with your community. Easily showcase activity data for NFTs, webpages, and more with a public stats page (in descending order). Feel free to spice up this app with your own custom colors, branding, and design!

## Background

communityStats uses the [Leto Analytics API](https://letodev.gitbook.io/getting-started/documentation/analytics-rest-api) to display a view count for each CID. To make it easy, steps are included to host the communityStats page on IPFS hosting provider, Spheron. This is an awesome IPFS hosting provider, but technically communityStats can be hosted on any cloud provider.

Before uploading to any hosting provider, simply change out the hardcoded CIDs currently in the code to your CIDs and the stats page is ready to go!

> **_Note_**: Only IPFS CIDs that have been accessed through the [Leto IPFS Gateway](https://letodev.gitbook.io/getting-started/documentation/ipfs-gateway-api) will return a view count, called "numberAccessed.


## Getting Started
